Step 1 (Scanning)
- machine has been scanned using Nmap
- machine has been reverted and re-scanned.

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- Target is running apache on port 80.
- Gobuster reveals directory '/cgi-bin/user.sh'.
- Apache plus ubuntu versions search reveals shellshock exploit.
- https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34900

Step 3 (Foot hold)
- Change the directory which shellshock exploit will interact with.
- Run with python.

- 'sudo -l' shows we can run perl as sudo without a password

Step 5 (Privilege escalation)
- 'sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec("/bin/bash")' drops us into a root shell

Step 6 (Pilfering)
