Enumeration:
- running an nmap scan we see port 22 and 80 are open.
- running gobuster we are shown /plugins/ and /phpmyadmin/ are available.
- going into /plugins/ we see blocky.jar, we download and unzip this file to reveal a .class file.

Gaining access:
- inside the .class file we see credentials to log into /phpmyadmin/
- when inside /phpmyadmin/ we see a file for wordpress users, here we get the username notch.
- using the username notch and the password from the .class file we ssh into the machine.

Priviledge escalation:
- running sudo -l we see we are sudoers with free roam.
- 'sudo su' will turn us into root.
