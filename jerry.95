Step 1 (Scanning)
- machine was scanned and rescanned using Nmap

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has apache tomcat running on port 8080
- gobuster shows directory /manager is available
- login using the default credentials 'tomcat/s3cret'
- page allows for .war files to be uploaded and run for server use

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- use msfvenom to make .war reverse shell
- upload to server and use nc to listen for connection back
- shell is a system level so no priv esc needed

Step 4 (Pilfering)
