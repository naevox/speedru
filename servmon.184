Servmon.184

Step 1 (scanning)
- host was pinged and reverted to ensure it is working as intended

Step 2 (enumeration)
- using nmap to port sweep we see port 21 and 80 are open
- Ftp into the machine we see Nathan and nadines user directory
- Inside nadines directory we see a file called confidential.txt is available
- We are not able to get the file due to lack of permission but we can read it using the syntax ‘get confidential.txt -‘
- Here we see a password list is available inside Nathan’s desktop directory
- On port 80 we see nvm-1000 which is vulnerable to path traversal 
- Using burp we access the password list using the directory request ‘/../../../../../../../../../../Users/Nathan/Desktop/Passwords.txt’

Step 2 (gaining access)
- with the previous nmap scab we see port 22 is also open
- with these passwords we are able to ssh into the machine as nadine using the 4th password down the list

Step 3 (enumeration)
-
