step 1 (enumeration)
- nmap scan reveals port 8500 open
- opening the port in a web browser reveals coldfusion directories
- enumeration of the directories reveals the version is coldfusion 8

step 2 (gaining access)
- a quick google search reveals coldfusion 8 is vulnerable to information disclosure, further research reveals the administrator hash location is kept in \ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties.
- using the syntax http://site/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties%00en we are able to find the admin sha1 hash
- running hash identifier we see the hash is SHA1 so using an online decoder we find the hash is for the key 'happyday'
- logging into th administrator interface with the username admin and password happyday 

step 3 (enumeration)
