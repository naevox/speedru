step 1 (enumeration)
- nmap scan reveals port 8500 open
- opening the port in a web browser reveals coldfusion directories
- enumeration of the directories reveals the version is coldfusion 8

step 2 (gaining access)
- running searchsploit on coldfusion 8 reveals a metasploit module for arbitrary file upload
- running the module out of the box fails due to coldfusion delayed responce
- opening burp we set the proxy option to redirect the request from localhost:8500 to 10.10.10.11:8500
- running a nc listener to the port specified in the payload loads a reverse shell once the responce has gone through

step 3 (enumeration)
-
