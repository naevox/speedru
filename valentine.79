Step 1 (Scanning)
- host was scanned and rescanned using Nmap

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- host is running port 22 and 80
- gobuster on port 80 reveals directories /dev/, /encode, /decode
- going into /dev we see a file called 'hype_key' we see its in hex format so we use an online decoder
- using nmap vuln scan we see port 443 is vulnerable to heartbleed
- heartbleed output gives us a base64 encoded output which we use the /decoder directory to retrieve

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- placing the decoded 'hype_key' into a file called 'hyde.key' and using 'ssh -i hyde.key hype@10.10.10.79' we user ssh session
- running ps -aux we see a root process running tmux

Step 4 (Priviledge escalation)
- by running the tmux session which root owns we can hyjack the session and get access to a root shell

Step 5 (Pilfering)
