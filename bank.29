step 1 (enumeration)
- nmap scan reveals ports 53 and 80 open
- adding the IP and hostname to the /etc/hosts file we can navigate to the login webpage
- running dirbuster we can see the subdirectory /balance-transfers/ open
- navigating here we see one file with credentials for chris@bank.htb login

step 2 (gaining access)
- logging in we navigate to the support page
- viewing page source we see the admin has allowed for any file with .htb extention to run as .php
- adapting our php shell to call back to us we upload it with .htb extention
- we set up a nc listener with the port used for the script
- we click pn 'click here' under 'attachement'

step 3 (enumeration)
- running 'find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;' we find an 'emergency script with the SUID of root

step 4 (priviledge escalation)
- upgrade the reverse shell connection using python pty library
- run the emergency script
