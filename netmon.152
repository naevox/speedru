Step 1 (Scanning)
- scanning the target for open ports.
- reverting machine and repeating scan.

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has port 80 and 21 with anonymous ftp open.
- ftp into target for user flag.
- navigate to C:programdata\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor and ftp get backup file
- cat * | grep -B 20 (20 chars before) -A 20 (20 chars after) "prtgadmin"

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- As backup file is a year old increment the password recovered by 1 and login as admin
- Once in we exploit CVE-2018-9276 by adding a reverse powershell oneliner which we encoded in base64 and use nc to catch reverse shell

Step 4 (Priviledge Escalation)
- This step is not needed as the PRTG software is by default run as system.

Step 5 (Pilfering)
