Step 1 (Enumeration)
Target is running Apache on port 80.

Step 2 (Foot hold)
We will brute force the admin login using Hydra and getting the fields required using Burp Suite.
Once we are inside we see a page with an SSH key, we use this key to SSH into the server as a standard user.

Step 3 (Enumeration)
Upon login we see a script which reads the shadow file.
We run strings and see that this file uses the command 'cat /etc/shadow' as a root process.

Step 4 (Privilege escalation)
In /tmp directory make the bash script '#!/bin/sh; /bin/sh' which will simply run a new bash session.
Name the script cat.
Change the system call to our script using 'export PATH=/tmp:$PATH'.

Step 5 (Host enumeration)
