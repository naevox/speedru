Step 1 (Scanning)
- target was scanned and reverted/ re-scanned using nmap

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has ports 80 and 443 available
- program running is pfsense, googling the software we see it is for a router and port 80 is just a redirect to port 443 for ease of browser use
- running going to changelog we see the firewall is down due to configuration errors, this will aid in us scanning the target
- dirbuster shows the file 'system-users.txt' which hosts the username used and the password being default

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- to gain access we write the username 'rohit' and password 'pfsense'
- inside the API we see the version of pfsense which is 2.1.3
- googling an RCE exploit we see 'https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43560' available

Step 4 (Priviledge escalation)
- running the exploit against our target with the user credentials
- having a nc listener set to the lport we receive a root shell back as fpsense runs as a root process.

Step 5 (Pilfering)
