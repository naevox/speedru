Step 1 (Scanning)
- host was scanned using ICMP to check for run time
- target was scanned using nmap and reverted & re-scanned

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- host has many james processes running so a searchsploit revealed https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35513
- target has an email remote admin service running on 4555
- nc into 4555 and login with the default credentials specified in the exploit we found
- change the password to user Mindy and open using thunder bird

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- in Mindy's emails we see her password to ssh
- we run the exploit specified above changing the payload to a nc reverse shell to our attacking machine as Mindy has restrictive rbash running rather than bash.
- upgrading our shell using:
  - 'python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn ("/bin/bash")'
  - CTRL z
  - stty raw -echo
  - fg \<enter\>
  - export TERM=xterm

Step 4 (Priviledge escalation)
- running LinEnum.sh -t for thorough search we see a file which runs as a root process through cron
- edit the file /opt/tmp.py to instead of deleting all files in tmp when cron hits to instead make dash into a process we can use
- run the command 'dash'

Step 5 (Pilfering)
