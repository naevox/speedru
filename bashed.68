Step 1 (Enumeration)
- Target is running apache on port 80.
- gobuster reveales /dev

Step 2 (Foot hold)
- /dev directory has php based bash shell running within browser under www-data account.
- upload reverse shell for persistence and open nc listener.

Step 3 (Enumeration)
- 'sudo -l' will show which users can use sudo and which sudo commands.
- 'sudo -u scriptmanager bash' opens bash session under user scriptmanager which can sudo freely.

Step 4 (Privilege escalation)
- in /scripts edit test.py into becoming a reverse shell as its a process that runs in root.

Step 5 (Pilfering)
