step 1 (Enumeration)
- nmap scan reveals port 80,135,445,5985,49669 open
- open port 80 using a browser we see a login page with 'login as guest' on the bottom right
- in there download cisco config file posted by user 'Hazard'
- decode the passwords using hashcat for the 'secret' key and online 'cisco password 7' decoders
- running "python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/lookupsid.py 'Hazard:stealth1agent'@10.10.10.149" will retrieve the usernames on the active directory
- port 135 is open so we will use "rpcclient -U 'Hazard%stealth1agent' 10.10.10.149" to connect to it
- run 'lookupnames Hazard', copy the output except the last octet, set the final octet to 1000 and increment by one to enumerate all users on RPC client

step 2 (Gaining access)
- run the username and password list using crackmapexec aimed towards smb shares using the syntaxt: 
"crackmapexec smb -u <usernames.txt> -p <passwords.txt> --shares 10.10.10.149"
- looking at the nmap we see winRM is running so we are able to use 'evil-winrm' tool to get a remote shell 'https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm'

step 3 (Enumeration)
- downloading the sysinternals suite we find the tool 'procdump64.exe' which we run accepting '-accepteula' to dump currently running processes on a windows machine
- using the command 'Get-Process' we can get currently running processes on the machine
- here we see a firefox instance running which on a htb machine is weird, so we dump the process to view what is happening

step 4 (Priviledge escalation)
- running 'strings' we see an administrator username and password which we use to psexec.py into the machine remotely as administrator.
