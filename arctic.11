step 1 (enumeration)
- nmap scan reveals port 8500 open
- opening the port in a web browser reveals coldfusion directories
- enumeration of the directories reveals the version is coldfusion 8

step 2 (gaining access)
- a quick google search reveals coldfusion 8 is vulnerable to information disclosure, further research reveals the administrator hash location is kept in \ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties.
- using the syntax http://site/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties%00en we are able to find the admin sha1 hash
- running hash identifier we see the hash is SHA1 so using an online decoder we find the hash is for the key 'happyday'
- logging into the administrator interface with the username admin and password happyday 
- use OSINT to find coldfusin is made with java and make java msfvenom payload
- host payload using SimpleHTTPServer
- use scheduled task to download payload and use site mapper feature to see the directory which the web folders are held and write file to there

step 3 (enumeration)
- set up nc listener for the port specified and open payload using browser
- make a second meterpreter payload and upload it using powershell
- run exploit suggester msfconsole module

step 4 (priviledge escalation)
- use the exploit suggested by suggester module
