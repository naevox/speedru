Step 1 (Scanning)
- scan host for open ports
- revert machine and re-scan

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- Nmap port scan shows port 80 as the sole open port
- Gobuster shows directory /webservices/wp/ open and running wordpress with misconfiguration
- checking page source we see the developer misstyped the http extention for the url as http:/ instead of http:// for the application data
- running 'wpscan --url http://10.10.10.88:80/webservices/wp --enumerate ap --plugins-detection aggressive' we see the plugin 'gwolle' running
- searchsploit the plugin and we see a remote file inclusion vulnerability for the wp-load.php file
- changing reverse php payload to wp-load.php and running 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80' allows for our php script to be loaded and ran.

Step 3 (Gaining access)
- set up a nc listener to the specified php script port and wait for call back
- using tty to upgrade our shell we see we are logged in as www-data webservice

Step 4 (Lateral movement)
- running 'sudo -l' shows user oname can run tar as sudo
- using a tar sudo exploit found on GTFObins page we move to become user oname

Step 5 (Priviledge escalation)
- running LinEnum.sh script we see a custom process which runs every 5 minutes called backuperer
- locating the script we reverse engineer it to see what it does
- script runs as root process
- write a script which runs with the process to escalate user priviledges

Step 6 (Pilfering)
