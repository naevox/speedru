Step 1 (Enumeration)
- target is running SSH on port 22 and HTTP on port 80.
- visiting port 80 we see an elastix instance running.

Step 2 (Foot hold)
- using searchsploit we see elastix is vulnerable to local file inclusion. 
(https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637)
- opening the exploit we see the directory it requests and try it manually. 
(10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action)
- here we see the admin login and password for the elastix instance.
- opening SSH we attempt to login as root onto the machine which is successful.

Step 5 (Pilfering)
