Traceback.181

Step 1 (scanning)
- host was scanned using ICMP to ensure it is running

Step 2 (enumeration)
- host had port 80 open which directs to a page mentioning it was hacked and a backdoor was left behind. 
- Viewing the page source there is a comment ‘some of the best web shells that you might need’ from here we good the hacker alias on the webpage which leads us to a github repository
- I’m the GitHub account there is a section of webshells
- We use the webshell names in the url extensions, the shell ‘smevk.php’
- From here login with credentials ‘admin:admin’

Step 3 (gaining access)
- Edit a reverse php webshell and make it call back to your machine. 
- Use nc to catch the call home from the shell and upgrade the shell with ‘python3 -c ‘import pty; pty.spawn (“/bin/bash”)’
- Running ‘sudo -l’ we see we can run a lua command line IDE as sysadmin
- Making a script ‘os.execute(“/bin/bash”)’ we run it as sysadmin through ‘sudo -u sysadmin /home/webadmin/script.lua’

Step 4 (enumeration)
